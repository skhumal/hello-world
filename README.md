Hi there!

My name is Candy Siyabonga Khumalo, and I'm a Software Engineer based in Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa. I'm passionate about Front-End Web Development.
I enjoy doing research, reading, and traveling in my free time. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I'm excited to be working on this project and I hope to contribute my skills and knowledge to help it succeed.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
